                          At your SD (secondary or external) card (<b>Internal storage > Pictures|Movies > VIP Downloader</b> or <b>SD card/Removable storage > VIP Downloader > Pictures|Movies</b>). Or your folder of choice at a removable storage if
                          you have one. Be sure to enable the requested permissions. If not, useless.

                        <p><b>How does downloading private account media work?</b><br>
                          <b>Two ways:</b><br> 1. Long press a media (such as at /explore, /tags, /search or profile pages, any page which list thumbnails) to save. The app will download it when you signal a long press. <br>2. Visit its full page, and hit the
                          provided button to download. Login is required so that the app can see what you see without any special authorization. The app does not read, know, store nor care about your credentials. It just borrows your authorized eyes
                          under the hood.

                        <p><b>How does Instagram scraping work?</b><br>
                          It is a simple one, not so robust. Needs manual intervention due to the pages are dynamically built and destroyed client-side. <br><b>Steps:</b> <br>1. Scroll to the bottom of the page to begin collecting links, and up again
                          to verify links collected. Or keep hitting <b>Rescan</b> to auto-scroll till the bottom reached. <br>2. Hit the Scrape button, and wait for the spider to finish its job.

                        <p><b>Instagram scraping requirements?</b><br>
                          - Currently only works for profile pages with small thumbnails, not those with large images. Although scraping /tags, or /explore pages is doable, we\'ll postpone this feature till enough requests. <br>- Strong internet
                          connection. <br>- Large size of device external storage (30gb+ to play safe), else you will be locked down due to out of space exception. Do not panic, though. Just hit <b>Abort</b>. Manage your space, move or delete files.
                          Switch or plug in a new empty card. Be sure to select it via <b>Organize directories</b>.

                        <p><b>Is scraping safe for my account?</b><br>
                          No. Use at your own risk. You had been warned before scraping, you will get banned. If not prepared, and not knowing how to play safe yourself, do not be tempted to scrape. Necessary measures had been provided to minimize
                          the ban algorithm triggers such as to make it behave like human, no guarantee whatsoever.

                        <p><b>The app is not functioning when I remove my SD card?</b><br>
                          Yes, of course. If you chose a removable SD card for storage, then removed/ plugged out, the app has no way to fetch its stored data. Unless you have multiple slots. Plugging it back in should make the app functional again.
                          <hr>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>I forgot my PIN. How to reset?</b><br>
                          Please note the PIN. Visit Android system settings (<b>Settings > Apps > VIP Downloader > Storage > Clear data</b>). This app\'s data will be lost like first install. Your downloaded photos and videos are safe at the
                          above-mentioned storage, but no longer accessible by this app. In order to have a functional app again with the old data, rebuild database based on your database backup at runtime. Visit <b>Settings > Database > Rebuild
                            database</b>. This app should be functional again.
                          <hr>

                        <p><b>I purchase the pro version. How to migrate old data into new app?</b><br>
                          Visit <b>Settings > Database > Migrate database</b>. The old data should be re-imported into the new app.
                          <hr>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>I rebuilt database, succeeded, but see no images/ videos?</b><br>
                          Be sure to re-open any directories you initially chose (any which contains <b>VIPDownloader</b> directory) via <b>Organize Directories</b> button or visit <b>Settings > Storage > Organize Directories</b>. Basically you must
                          re-grant access to the app if you reset the app data, or migrate from free to pro. You should see the images/ videos again.
                          <hr>

                        <p><b>Some features not functioning?</b><br>
                          Visit Android <b>Settings > Apps > VIP Downloader > Permissions</b>, or visit <b>Settings > Permissions</b> for a shortcut. Check the 3 dot menu on the top right to view <b>All permissions</b>. Enable the needed permissions.
                          Anything disabled will not function. Restart the app! Don\'t be scared by descriptions unless you distrust the app developer. VIP Downloader is harmless regardless of spooky descriptions. Please note, sideloading is not
                          supported as we use the new upload format using App bundle, not regular APK. Only install via Google Play Store!

                        <p><b>Sometimes I get pictures and videos downloaded real fast, sometimes slow?</b><br>
                          First check your internet connection. I also noticed Instagram may slightly be busy at times. Bear with it.

                        <p><b>How to repost videos or pictures?</b><br>
                          Tap any thumbnail to open the gallery display. Find a button with a plus (+) sign, and tap <b>Regram/ repost</b> button. Be sure to give credit to owners, and seek for their permissions.
                          <hr>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Nothing downloaded?</b><br>
                          Wait for a few seconds. In order for auto download to work, be sure that <b>VIP Downloader</b> is already open before tapping <b>Copy link</b> on Instagram. You can tap <b>VIP Downloader</b> icon when prompted to verify the
                          download process. Or ignore it to continue browsing. The icon will disappear after a few seconds. Yet images or pictures should be downloaded automatically as long as this app is not killed. If failed for a reason, you can
                          always manually paste the clipboard link into the provided text input. Lastly, also check if the image or video is already downloaded. Be sure to bookmark or fave them at Instagram to avoid unnecessary confusion with
                          downloads.

                        <p><b>Can I set a video cover as a wallpaper, too?</b><br>
                          Yes, just hit <b>Set wallpaper</b> button at video gallery. In order to have full screen video cover, enable <b>Create video cover</b> at <b>Settings > Personalization</b>. It is disabled to avoid unwanted covers. Only small
                          video thumbnails are created by default.

                        <p><b>I want hamburger, not home-back arrow.</b><br>
                          Go to <b>Settings > Appearance > Hamburger everywhere</b>. Enable to show hamburger everywhere. Useful for quick access to menu items. Then you can use your device navbar back arrow to go home. You can also swipe from the
                          left edge to reveal the menu.
                          <hr>

                        <p><b>Why I see a slight blinking when viewing the gallery large image?</b><br>
                          Images are firstly loaded as small thumbnails to avoid OutOfMemory issue. Once you focus on a gallery image, a larger image version replaces the thumbnail.
