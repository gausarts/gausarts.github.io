                            This way the data is more managable at larger storage. You can always change locations to organize better, no problems. Be sure to enable the requested permissions. If not, useless.

                            Due to the latest restrictions, providing a dummy or nothing-to-lose Instagram account is required via <b>Settings > Private mode</b> in order to make it work for both public and private accounts. No need to be the same as
                            the currently-in-use Instagram account, except for private accounts (or at least both accounts, if different, should follow the same private accounts).

                          <div>
                            <b>Three ways:</b>
                            <ol>
                              <li>Long press a media thumbnail (such as seen at /explore, /tags, /search or profile pages, any page which list small thumbnails) to save. The app will download it when you signal a long press.</li>
                              <li>Visit its full page, and hit or press the Instagram <b>Bookmark</b> icon at full page.</li>
                              <li>Use Instagram app, and hit regular <b>Copy link</b> for both public and private accounts.</li>
                            </ol>
                            For the first two, login via app web interface is required so that the app can see what you see without any special authorization. The app does not care about your credentials. It just borrows your authorized eyes under
                            the hood due to Instagram restrictions.

                          <summary>How does Instagram scraping work?</summary>
                          <div>
                            It is not real scraping. Scraping word is used to simplify the wordings. It is more like download-multiple-files-once than regular scraping. Needs manual intervention due to the pages are dynamically built and destroyed
                            client-side. <br><b>Steps:</b> <br>
                            <ol>
                              <li>Scroll to the bottom of the page to begin collecting links, and up again
                                to verify links collected. Or keep hitting <b>Rescan</b> to auto-scroll till the bottom reached. </li>
                              <li>Hit the <b>Scrape</b> button, and wait for the spider to finish its job.</li>
                            </ol>
                            Again this is not scraping. It is just a convenient way to download multiple files at one click. Use it wisely and responsibly for good purposes.

                            <ul>
                              <li>Currently only works for profile pages with small thumbnails, not those with large images. Although scraping /tags, /explore, or practically any pages is doable, this feature is postponed till enough requests.</li>
                              <li>Strong internet

                                move or delete files.
                                Switch or plug in a new empty card. Be sure to select it via <b>Organize directories</b>.</li>

                          <div>
                            Yes, as long as the app web interface displaying Instagram is opened. Scraping is run at another thread. Not your main UI thread. But that means you are doing several things simultaneously which immediately smells like
                            human bot behaviors. Staying tuned till all downloads are finished is recommended unless you provide different accounts via <b>Settings > Private mode</b>.

                        </details>

                          <div>
                            No. Use at your own risk. Use a dummy account. It is not allowed. You had been warned before scraping. If not prepared, and not knowing how to play nice, do not scrape. Necessary measures had been provided to minimize the
                            algorithm triggers such as to make it behave like human with some configurable intervals, reduces rate limits, persistent UA and cookies, etc. No guarantees whatsoever.

                          <div>
                            No recommendations. Unfortunately scraping is bot behaviors, hardly human. Bots are b.a.n.n.e.d, mostly. Just know what you are doing. Common sense applies:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Normal human actions: click, open, close, back, scroll up and down. Do not repeat the same task too much, including donwload, or even like, too much. Don't do anything just too much. Anything preceded by too is not
                                good, including too good.</li>
                              <li>Stop downloading anything when reaching 300 per 24 hour. Unless you are caught earlier. You will be prompted a number when scraping, make a note.</li>
                              <li>Only download 100 at most at a time. You can rescan the rest tomorrow.</li>
                              <li>Have backup dummy accounts, many.</li>
                              <li>Use different dummy accounts, follow the same private one. Input the first at <b>Settings > Private mode</b>. The other at Instagram.</li>
                              <li>Use the same dummy accounts, and do trials and errors at your own descretion.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </div>

                        <details>
                          <summary>Why scraping not work?</summary>
                          <div>
                            Only applicable to FREE version. Before scraping you will be presented a video ad. A minimum 32 seconds threshold and 30 points is required before you close it. If you close it too early, scraping is not triggered.

                            To organize your photos or videos thematically for offline convenience. You can put wild life media into <b>Wildlife</b> folder, food and beverages into <b>Cooking</b>, etc. Above all, you can put them all into an external
                            removable disk for greater storage rooms rather than being stored internally.

                          <div>
                            Yes, of course. If you chose a removable SD card for storage, then removed/ plugged out, the app has no way to fetch its stored data. Unless you have multiple slots. Plugging it back in should make the app functional
                            again.

                            Please note the PIN. Visit Android system settings (<b>Settings > Apps > VIP Downloader > Storage > Clear data</b>). This app's data will be lost like first install. Your downloaded photos and videos are safe at the
                            above-mentioned storage, but no longer accessible by this app. In order to have a functional app again with the old data, rebuild database based on your database backup at runtime. Visit <b>Settings > Database > Rebuild
                              database</b>. This app should be functional again.

                            Visit <b>Settings > Database > Migrate database</b>. The old data should be re-imported into the new app. Be sure to backup the free version beforehand.

                          <div>
                            Be sure to re-open any directories you initially chose (any which contains <b>VIPDownloader</b> directory) via <b>Organize Directories</b> button or visit <b>Settings > Storage > Organize Directories</b>. Basically you
                            must re-grant access to the app if you reset the app data, or migrate from free to pro. You should see the images/ videos again. The reason is each flavor is unique in regards of permissions, even if the difference is just
                            free and pro.

                            permissions. Anything disabled will not function. Restart the app! Don't be scared by descriptions unless you distrust the app developer. VIP Downloader is harmless regardless of spooky descriptions. Please note,
                            sideloading is not supported as we use the new upload format using App bundle, not regular APK. Only install via Google Play Store!

                          <div>
                            Tap any thumbnail to open the gallery display, or hit <b>Images</b> or <b>Videos</b> medu on the drawer. Find a button with a Repost sign (like seen at Twitter with Retweet), and tap that <b>Regram or repost</b> button. Be
                            sure to give credit to owners, and seek for their permissions. Or provide the configurable watermark as a credit in the least.

                            Wait for a few seconds. In order for auto download to work, be sure that <b>VIP Downloader</b> is already open before downloading anything on Instagram. You can tap <b>VIP Downloader</b> icon when prompted to verify
                            the download process. Or ignore it to continue browsing. The icon will disappear after a few seconds. Yet images or videos should be downloaded automatically as long as this app is not killed. <br><br>If failed for a
                            reason, you can
                            always manually paste the clipboard link into the provided text input. Lastly, also check if the image or video is already downloaded. Be sure to bookmark or fave them at Instagram to avoid unnecessary confusion with
                            downloads.

                            Hit <b>Repost</b> button. At Instagram, when prompted to add caption, simply long press on the textarea, and press <b>Paste</b> prompt.

                            Yes, just hit <b>Set wallpaper</b> button at video gallery. In order to have full screen video cover, enable <b>Create video cover</b> at <b>Settings > Personalization</b>. It is disabled to avoid unwanted covers. Only
                            small
                            video thumbnails are created by default.

                            Go to <b>Settings > Appearance > Hamburger everywhere</b>. Enable to show hamburger everywhere. Useful for quick access to menu items. Then you can use your device navbar back arrow to go home. You can also swipe from the
                            left edge to reveal the menu.

                            Images are firstly loaded as small thumbnails to avoid OutOfMemory issue. Once you focus on a gallery image, a larger image version replaces the thumbnail.

                            <b>Settings > Private mode > Kill the service</b>. The notification needs to stand by to listen for "COPY LINKS" if using non-private mode. You can kill it if you always goes Private mode.

                            Not yet, sorry. I haven't been able to make it nor remove that option due to a mix of videos and images. Please ignore for videos for now. It should work for images, though.

                          <div>
                            Only applicable to FREE version to minimize ads interruptions, or be eligible for scrapings. Tap the top-right corner reward icon, or keep watching when presented by the app features. <br><br>Everytime you watch a video ad
                            after a minimum 32 seconds
                            threshold met, you will earn 10 points. If you close it before the threshold 32 seconds, you will still get the bonus point 2, but not the feature (scraping, free watermarks, etc.). Meaning scraping, etc. will not be
                            executed.
                            <ul>
                              <li>1 download = 1 point at regular one-at-a-time download.</li>
                              <li>Scraping requires 30 points. Scraping can download 100 or 300 items at once if you have the minimum point and meet the 32 seconds threshold.</li>
                              <li>Ads-free requires 3000 points. No ads (banner or fullscreen ones) will be shown.</li>
                            </ul>

                            Those are the obvious advantages of the reward, or point system. <br><br>Shortly, when you have free time to be interrupted,
                            be sure to keep earning points so that when you don't want interruptions, you are totally free of them. If you intend to download 300 items per day, consider keeping your points above the minimum to get ads-free
                            interruptions. <br><br>If you are sick of points, consider a PRO version.

                              <li>Browser will be killed if the app is put into background or overview. If scraping, it will be terminated.</li>
                              <li>Scraper will start at 32 seconds threshold after watching video with the above-mentioned minimum points. If the video is closed before 32 seconds, no scraping spider will run.</li>
                              <li>No watermark option is not saved.</li>
