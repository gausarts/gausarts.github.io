                          <summary>Please be informed before reviews:</summary>
                          <div>
                            Be sure to read <b>How to use</b> and <b>FAQs</b> for more detailed informations. Below are few quick potential misses:
                            <ul>
                              <li>The app doesn't collect sensitive end-user data, nor your Instagram, etc. credentials.<br></li>
                              <li>Be sure to allow the required permissions when prompted, else features are crippled, useless.<br></li>
                              <li>If you keep getting 403 (Forbidden response) after being logged-in, it means the link is protected, blocked, gated or restricted. Just delete and ignore. Either you have to register or login first, or pay premium subscription if any such requirements. Other failures like 404 (Not Found), etc. will also be prompted. At any rate, we cannot download if such failures happen, sorry. They are beyond our power. Delete such failing  processed links. Please try other links instead. Read Disclaimer and FAQ for more detailed info.</li>
                              <li>Be sure <b>Battery saver</b> feature turned off specific for this app to allow downloads via background processing. This varies based on devices: <br>1. (System) Settings > Battery & performance > Battery saver : Off. <br>2. (System) Settings > Battery & performance > App battery saver > VIPDownloader > Background settings: No restrictions. Check out your system <b>Settings</b> for the correct location of this particular settings.</li>
                              <li>This app does not supply or include any media or content.</li>
                              <li>We do not endorse the streaming or downloading of copyright protected material without permission of the copyright holder.</li>
                              <li>Some ISPs like those in Indonesia block Reddit, Vimeo, etc. Use reliable non-free VPN, proxies, etc., or stay safe.<br></li>
                              <li>Downloads will surely fail under three known constraints, that is when being at: low storage, offline, and unsupported sites. Any failed works will try to resume specific for low storage only if the scheduled job is not terminated by the system, yet. Or expired.</li>
                              <li>Please check your internet speed at <a href="https://fast.com">fast.com</a>, or install Internet Speed Meter etc. Slow speed breaks downloads.<br></li>
                              <li>Most convenient download features are via the app web interface (a minimal browser), not the official apps, nor external browsers. Check out <b>How to use</b>. This is a very minimal browser seen at apps like TwitterLite, FacebookLite, etc. Do not use it for registrations, use it for browsing and downloading instead only.<br></li>
                              <li>All downloads assumed the media assets are internal to each supported sites, or their networks. Some sites like Reddit, or Twitter, point links to external ones like cnn.com, etc. These external sites are not supported. Meaning downloads may break.<br></li>
                              <li>Some sites embed a post/ tweet in another post/ tweet like Reddit or Twitter. Downloading them only works for a stand alone post/ tweet, not the one embedded inside another. Just visit its original post to download.<br></li>
                              <li>Youtube videos embedded at Reddit, Twitter, etc. are NOT supported.<br></li>
                              <li>Links for sensitive contents and private accounts are gated with some time-sensitive tokens. The links can expire any seconds. Once failed at slow internet connections, old links are expired already which cause broken downloads. Delete them, and re-download. Or ignore if it keeps failing.<br></li>
                              <li>If something is broken, unless it keeps happening, try restarting the app, and see if any better.<br></li>
                              <li>Do not scrape! Your accounts and IPs subject to b.a.n. When banned, you cannot access the websites! Have backups, paid VPN, proxies, etc., many. Free VPNs may drop your speed from 1MB to 100KB. Again, do not scrape! If you do, please use it wisely and responsibly. I can think of one real-live example -- saving my limited time to foster my creativity. I am, the app developer, an artist by nature. I am studying arts which interest me much, and need offline room to save time and mobile data usages. I don't repost them myself, at least so far. They are for personal study. Hopefully you can make this app beneficial for your own highest good as well in your life journey. Only Instagram profiles can be scraped for now.<br></li>
                              <li>Specific to social media sharing: while some apps can receive multiple images like Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, etc., some others cannot such as Instagram (See https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/sharing-to-feed), Reddit, etc. TikTok cannot even receive one without API which is only granted to few and its own partners. Please bear with it and do not send negative reviews for something that the native apps don't even support in the first place using Android standards. It is simply beyond our power.</li>
                              <li>Storage permission is required to save downloaded files into public/ shared/ external folders so you can browse them at public folders (Pictures/ Movies), and don't run out of internal space. If rejected, they are stored internally which can be accessed by rooted devices only, and may result in out of memory issues. Alternatively choose your own folders via Organize Directories option.</li>
                              <li>One star is a mere hatred at Android. It took me literally 3000 hours to build this app. Kindly take it into consideration. Please use the provided <b>Feedback</b> form if you have any suggestions, or feedbacks. Truly appreciated.</li>
                            </ul>

                          <div>
                            <ul>
                              <li>This app doesn't use official APIs. Meaning it may break when the sites change their internals. If it was working, then suddenly breaks, please report via <b>Feedback</b> form. Kindly do not submit negative reviews when this happens. It is simply beyond our power. We'll do our best to fix it ASAP thanks to your reports.<br></li>
                              <li>Reddit videos have no sound. I haven't been able to mux the audio, yet. Please ignore Reddit till future fixes.<br></li>
                              <li>Do not use the app web interface to register accounts. It is just a webview, not real browser, too many limitations may break registration process, like upload, paste etc. Use real browsers or official apps for registrations. Only use it once you have an account to login and download, not to register a new one. This also means the web app is not as robust as the official apps. Please bear with it.<br></li>
                              <li>TikTok has poor UI for its web presence. SnackVideo has no usable web presence at all, use the official app instead. Nothing we can do about it.<br></li>

                            <p>The app doesn't collect your social credentials, nor anything sensitive. It just borrows your authorized eyes under the hood. We do collect crash reports and user interactions using common third party analytics, and via your own conscious submission of the crash reports (<b>About > Crash report</b>). If you don't submit it, no data is sent to us. You can also remove the submitted data on the email body before submission.</p>
                            <p>The following are needed to properly address potential crash solutions: Environment, Android version, OS version, VIP Downloader version and flavor, Model, Device, Product, SDK, Screen density and resolution. These data are generic to help troubleshoot and fix bugs. None is sensitive. You can also remove some info as needed. We do not share the collected data. Both are solely to improve user experience and engagement.</p>

                            <div>
                            <p>The VIP Downloader offers features such as adding and deleting pictures or videos, storing files at external removable storage.</p>
                            <p>These features need your permissions. Without these permissions the app is crippled:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>INTERNET to download pictures, or videos. The system may likely grant a little portion of this permission. This limited internet access may suffice. If however things do not function properly, be sure to enable the needed permissions.<br></li>
                              <li>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE/ WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to store photos and videos on your external SD card. None of your personal data is read or written/ overwritten.<br></li>
                              <li>MEDIA_CONTENT_CONTROL to play and stop the videos.<br></li>
                              <li>SET_WALLPAPER to set pictures or video covers as wallpapers.<br></li>
                              <li>CAMERA to add your own camera pictures into gallery.<br></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>They are only enabled on your own conscious approval. You will be asked for permissions before using this app. Also check out the <b>Settings > Permissions</b> to enable the rest. Again all is disabled by default until you enable it. If disallowed, they simply won't function. No hidden gimmicks.</p>
