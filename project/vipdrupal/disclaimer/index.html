                          <summary>Please be informed before reviews:</summary>
                          <div>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Please do not submit negative reviews for fun. Use the provided Feedback channel to help improve the app instead. Negative reviews without followups and updates after being corrected are like hit-and-run, not constructive and disheartening. It is a labor of love for Drupal lovers to foster Drupal. Hopefully useful to stay updated in your busy days. Thank you for your kind considerations and positive supports!</li>
                              <li>The app doesn't collect sensitive end-user data. We do collect crash reports and user interactions using common third party analytics, and via your own conscious submission of the crash reports. Find the crash report at <b>About > Crash report</b>. If you don't submit it, no data is sent to us. You can also preview the submitted data on the email body before submission.</li>
                              <li>The following are needed to properly address potential crash solutions: Environment, Android version, OS version, DruPocket for Drupal version and flavor, Model, Device, Product, SDK, Screen density and resolution. You can also remove some info as needed. We do not share the collected data. Both are solely to improve user experience and engagement.</li>
                              <li>The DruPocket for Drupal offers additional features such as adding new personal notes/ todos or feeds, archiving, editing and deleting existing notes/ feeds. Only the pro version supports deletions, though. These optional features may need optional permissions. <b>Optional</b> means none is enabled until you do so:
                                <ul>
                                  <li>INTERNET/ ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE to download new articles, feed pictures, connecting to Youtube or podcast provider sites to fetch and display more feeds. If you disallow, no news, videos or podcasts  will show. The system may likely grant a little portion of this permission. This limited internet access may suffice. If however things do not function properly, be sure to enable the needed permissions.<br></li>
                                  <li>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE/ WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to store/ cache news, Youtube, podcast images temporarily, and your favorites in CSV file. None of your personal data is read or written/ overwritten.<br></li>
                                  <li>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED/ VIBRATE to start alarm on device reboot for automatic scheduled article deletions older than the specified time: 2 months, 1 year, 2 years, etc.<br></li>
                                  <li>MEDIA_CONTENT_CONTROL/ READ_PHONE_STATE to play and stop the podcast in this app automatically, such as when a podcast running, and you want to receive a phone simply to avoid noises. The app does not read your phone data, nor contacts.<br> </li>
                                  </ul>
                              </li>
                              <li>They are only enabled on your own conscious approval. You will be asked for permissions before using this app. Also check out the <b>Settings > Permissions</b> to enable the rest. Again all is disabled by default until you enable it. If disallowed, they simply won't function. No hidden gimmicks.</li>
                              <li>The DruPocket for Drupal strives to leverage Android architecture components goodness. Fully fragmentized with just literally one activity. However it is at early stage, please bear in mind! It has not been battle-tested against million devices, yet. Should you find a bug or hiccup, please use the Feedback.</li>
                              <li>I am <b>Gaus Surahman</b>, the DruPocket for Drupal app developer, and this app is, not affiliated to Youtube or Drupal company or any of these news, podcasts, feeds providers, nor own them. The contents displayed in the application do not belong to me, or DruPocket for Drupal.

                              <li>This app doesn't use official APIs. Meaning it may break when the sites change their internals. If it was working, then suddenly breaks, please report via <b>Feedback</b> form. Kindly do not submit negative reviews when this happens. It is simply beyond our power. We'll do our best to fix it ASAP thanks to your reports. We'll consider using APIs at a more matured stage, so stay tuned.<br></li>
                              <li>Camera not working in Android 10 (API 29). Please ignore till the next fix.<br></li>
